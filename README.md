# <challenge-1-horiseon>

## Description
    
This Project was the first assignment for my Coding bootcamp through the UCLA extension program. Using my knowledge I've aquired in the first two weeks of this program I followed the instructions to complete the assignment as requested. A few of the problems that I solved included using my knowledge of HTML semantic elements I upgraded the provided code to make it more descriptive. I also added alt attributes to the pictures and icons to make the code more accessible. I gave the code a better fitting title, and I condensed repetitive CSS. I learned that when multiple elements use the same CSS you can dierct the same limes of CSS to affect them. In doing this assignment I also became a little more comfortable using and commiting my work to Github and I learned how to make a readme file.
